    title: "Fantopia",
    excerpt: "A bar project centered around arcades and consoles I've helped run for around a year, until I changed cities and had to drop it. I was mostly a late comer to help handle the administrative tasks such as accountability and web development since I loved the idea and they were looking for new partners. Ran for about two years until COVID-19 pandemic struck and had to close.",

    title: "La Liga bar",
    excerpt: "For about a year in Asunci√≥n I was part of the bar that was spawned by La Liga de Aventureros Paraguay which was intentended to be a place to play boardgames, eat and drink beer. It worked fine for a while, but unfortunately it was a side gig for all its members so it had to close down when no one had time to attend to the business. Fortunately, this happened around 6 months before the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    title: "Cat Feeder",
    excerpt: "Who doesn't love not having your cats wake you up at 5 AM because they're hungry? Powered by an Arduino Uno and a salvaged stepper motor from the 3D printer, this beast would connect via bluetooth with an Android App to configure the feeding times and sync up the clock. It used an internal battery-powered RTC module to keep track of time in case of a power outage.",

    title: "Tesla Coil",
    excerpt: "Of course I've built a Tesla Coil. The smell of ozone in the room still tastes interesting to me somehow. It was quite hard to build the high voltage components with limited resources. I remember winding the secondary coil was a pain and the primary didn't come out quite as spiral as I would've liked, but hey, it sparked!",

    excerpt: "That was what chatgpt said that I should orient my personal webpage, so here we are. This page is a place where I can dump the personal projects I've built over the years. Most of them, of course, unpolished. Some of them have been working for quite a bit of years (fingers crossed), others are waiting in my drawer for an up/recycling. The idea is that each little post will be a bubble floating around, interacting with different forces between each other and the cursor. Let's hope this one can grow in posts without becoming a memory killer.",

Just now, i've managed to implement this page using React and Vercel without much consultation to their respectives documentation. \n I have also added this page to the web for a sculptor friend. \n Check it out, he has very cool sculptures, and don't be shy to ask about shipping if you'd like one in your living room!",

    title: "Commissioned work",
    excerpt: "This was my first webpage that I did from scratch by commission. It is a very toned down version of Attendium, if you know what that is (if not, you can google it). It was a nice experience to have someone actually paying for what I could deliver, even if what I could/want to deliver was not like super pretty, it was pretty useful. Too bad the domain expired and I don't own it anymore, or that the bar closed down eventually.",

    excerpt: "In the showcase today: How I'm using ESPHome to add interfaces to my Home Assistant. This dirty looking gadget is an ESP8266 I had lying around to which I've added an RF 433MHz Rx module and an IR sensor. It sits next to my TV and interfaces with different remote controllers. The code is esentially a yaml file, although in my case I needed to compile it for an older version since my rflibs seemed to have some issues.",

    title: "My first arduino project.",
    excerpt: "What's nice about avoiding throwing things and getting old is finding jewels like this one. It was a very crude pair of relays, connected to a transistor board that was supposed to be integrated at some point, connected to the arduino I/O ports. I'd wish I had a picture of the setup, but it seems that has been lost to time. I'll update with pictures of the new sensor box.",

    title: "Starting a web development journey using Google Docs.",
    excerpt: "How cloud services makes programming to solve your issues feel either extremely complex, or extremely weird. I needed a solution to have a webpage connected to a google spreadsheet, since that's how the people I was working with knew how to access data, so I came up with this spreadsheet that implemented a point-and-click interface to choose items from a menu and registering the order. This Frankestein was made with JS libraries of Google Drive, Macros and good old Excel. Watching it actually be useful could've given anyone the chills.",

    title: "ArduPlanter",
    excerpt: "This tiny box lasted a good couple of years with nothing but a solar power and the will to keep giving information even after most of my plants had died. Made with an ArduinoNano at heart, it would send RF signals to the ESP base to track my outside Temp&Humidity and my plant moisture sensors. The ones I had bought broke, but I could reuse their voltage comparators with some graphite rods harvested from an art shop.",

A QR code is generated which can be scanned at the event to recover the updated information about that player's table and ticket purchasing history.",
